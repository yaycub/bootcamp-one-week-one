      I play wayyyy too many Video Games, mostly on PC. I like every genre of video games, unless it's a sport game.

    <section class="comics">
      I also read comics. I haven't kept up with this currently, but that just means I will have a lot to read soon. My current obsession is "The Wicked + The Divine" by Jamie McKelvie & Kieron Gillen.
